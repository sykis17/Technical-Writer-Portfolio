# PIOSEE Decision Making Model

The PIOSEE model provides a structured framework to manage complex non-normal situations, preventing the crew from rushing into an incorrect course of action.

| Stage | Action | Crew Tasks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P** | **Problem** | Identify the root cause. Don't treat the symptom; find the disease. What systems are affected? |
| **I** | **Information** | Check Fuel, Weather, NOTAMs, and Aircraft Performance (QRH). |
| **O** | **Options** | Brainstorm at least 3 paths (e.g., Continue, Return, Divert). |
| **S** | **Select** | Choose the most conservative and safe option. |
| **E** | **Execute** | Brief the crew (NITS), notify ATC, and fly the plan. |
| **E** | **Evaluate** | Continuously check: "Is the chosen course still best? Has something changed?" |


Note: Standardizing these models in the OM-A reduces the "Knowledge Hole" in the Swiss Cheese Model. By providing a clear, repetitive structure for communication and decision-making, we ensure that even a fatigued crew under high stress can maintain a consistent level of safety.
