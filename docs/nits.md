# NITS Briefing (Emergency Communication)

The NITS briefing is the standardized method for the Captain to communicate an emergency or non-normal situation to the Senior Cabin Crew Member (SCCM).

| Letter | Heading | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **N** | **Nature** | What is the problem? (e.g., Engine Fire, Rapid Depressurization) |
| **I** | **Intentions** | What are we doing? (e.g., Diversion to Dublin, Emergency Descent) |
| **T** | **Time** | How many minutes until touchdown? |
| **S** | **Special Instructions** | Is an evacuation required? Which side to evacuate? Any blocked exits? |

---

### Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. **Pilot:** Calls SCCM to the flight deck or via interphone.
2. **Pilot:** States "I am giving you a NITS briefing. Please have a pen and paper ready."
3. **SCCM:** Writes down the information and **repeats it back exactly** to confirm understanding.

Note: Standardizing these models in the OM-A reduces the "Knowledge Hole" in the Swiss Cheese Model. By providing a clear, repetitive structure for communication and decision-making, we ensure that even a fatigued crew under high stress can maintain a consistent level of safety.
